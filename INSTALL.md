# Want to have these statistics for yourself?

It is possible to create all these stats for your own Strava profile.
Just follow the steps below. If you experience any issues with any of the steps,
feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/strava-activities/issues/new). I'll be glad to help you out üíÖ.

## What you'll need

* A Strava API key
* A GitHub account

## Installation

* Make sure your logged in with your GitHub account
* Start off by showing some ‚ù§Ô∏è and give this repo a star
* [Fork this repository](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/strava-activities/fork)
  (forking is fancy word for copying)
* The first thing you'll want to do is delete all my personal data. You don't want these mixed up
  with your own.
  * Navigate to https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY-NAME]/tree/master/files/challenges 
    and delete this directory (three dots in right-hand corner)
  * Navigate to https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY-NAME]/tree/master/database
    and delete all three subdirectories
* Navigate to your newly created repository `Actions secrets and variables` page (https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY-NAME]/settings/secrets/actions)
  Keep this page open, you will need to add several secrets here
* Next, navigate to your [Strava API settings page](https://www.strava.com/settings/api).
  Copy the `client ID` and `client secret` and create two new secrets:
    * __name__: STRAVA_CLIENT_ID, __value__: `client ID` copied from Strava API settings page
    * __name__: STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET, __value__: `client secret` copied from Strava API settings page
* Now you need to obtain a `Strava API refresh token`. This might be the hardest step.
    * Navigate to https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#d-how-to-authenticate
      and scroll down to "_For demonstration purposes only, here is how to reproduce the graph above with cURL:_"
    * Follow the 11 steps explained there
    * Make sure you set the `scope` in step 2 to `activity:read_all` to make sure your refresh token has access to all activities
    * Create a secret with the refresh token you obtained: __name__: STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN, __value__: The `refresh token` you just obtained
* The last thing you need to do is edit the `update-strava-activities.yml` file:
    * Navigate to https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY-NAME]/edit/master/.github/workflows/update-strava-activities.yml
    * Scroll down to
    ```yml
    name: Commit and push changes
    run: |
      git config --global user.name 'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME'
      git config --global user.email 'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com'
      git add .
      git status
      git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m"Updated strava activities"
      git push
    ```

    * Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your own username
    * Remove this code block completely

    ```yml
    name: ntfy.sh
    uses: robiningelbrecht/ntfy-action@v1.0.0
    if: always()
    with:
    url: ${{ secrets.NTFY_URL }}
    topic: ${{ secrets.NTFY_TOPIC }}
    icon: 'https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/profile/achievements/starstruck-default.png'
    job_status: ${{ job.status }}
    ```

    * Click `commit changes` at the top right-hand corner

## Some things to consider

* Only (virtual) bike rides are imported, other sports are not relevant for these stats
* Because of technical (Strava) limitations, not all Strava challenges
  can be imported. Only the visible ones on your public profile can be imported
* Strava statistics will be re-calculated once a day. If you want to
  re-calculate these manually, navigate to https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY-NAME]/actions/workflows/update-strava-activities.yml
  and click `Run workflow` at the right-hand side
* Features still to add / finish
    * Import and display activity images
    * Display per activity weather data
    * Change activity heatmap to always include the last 12 months
